This file runs the panel regressions analysing if areas with financing of forest protection have a higher forest cover compared to similar control areas. That is, the underlying database has performed the matching already.

```{r include=FALSE}
#### ---- clean workspace, set options -----
rm(list=ls())
options(scipen = 999)
# get packages
lop <- c("dplyr", "plm", "stargazer", "tidyverse", "cem")
newp <- lop[!(lop %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(newp)) install.packages(newp)
lapply(lop, require, character.only = TRUE)

# set working directory
setwd("~/shared/datalake/mapme.protectedareas")


```
