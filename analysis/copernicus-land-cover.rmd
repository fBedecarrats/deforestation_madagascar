# Introduction

The actual surface cover of ground is known as Land Cover. The land cover data shows us how much of the region is covered by forests, rivers, wetlands, barren land, or urban infrastructure thus allowing the observation of land cover dynamics over a period of time. There are many products available for the analysis of global land cover classes, however, the European Union's Earth Observation programme called as Copernicus provides high quality, readily available land cover products from year 2015 to 2019 free of cost for the public use.

Here, in this analysis we are going to compute the area of land cover classes within the region of interest from the rasters downloaded from Copernicus Land Cover Viewer.

### Processing Workflow

The purpose of this analysis is to compute area of different land cover classes present in the polygon of interest. In order to get the results, we need to go through several steps of processing as shown in the routine workflow:

![](assets/workflows/land_cover_area_routine.jpg)


# Prepare land cover raster data

The 20X20 gridded rasters were downloaded to cover the extent of Latin America for years 2015 to 2019. Later, for individual years, all the rasters were merged to get the single big raster for particular years. Here, we will load the big raster for the year 2015.

```{r loadRaster, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

# load raster land cover
lc <- rast("../../datalake/mapme.protectedareas/input/copernicus_global_land_cover/2015/Latin_America_LC_2015.tif")
# view raster details
lc
```


# Download and Prepare WDPA Polygons

For this analysis, we would choose one WDPA polygon from the country Venezuela. We can download the WDPA polygons from the package `wdpar` and then filter out the desired polygon using WDPAID with package `dplyr`.

We will then reproject the downloaded polygon sample to WGS84 to match with the raster data. Since, we are using package `terra` for raster processing, so it is necessary to load the sample polygon as `spatVector`. 

```{r fetchWdpar, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

# load sample WDPA polygon from country: Venezuela
ven <- wdpa_fetch("VEN")%>%
  filter(WDPAID %in% 555705224)
# reproject to the WGS84
ven <- st_transform(ven, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")
# load as spatVector for terra compatiility
ven_v <- vect(ven)
# plot the PA polygon
plot(ven[1])
```


# Crop the land cover raster

Since we already loaded raster and polygon successfully to our workspace, we can now perform further processing that would be to clip the raster layer by the selected shapefile polygon both by its extent and mask layer. `Crop` returns the raster to its bounding box whereas `mask` returns the raster to defined vector polygon layer.

```{r cropRaster, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

# crop raster by polygon
ven_crop <- terra::crop(lc, ven_v)
# plot the cropped raster layer
plot(ven_crop)
# mask the raster by polygon 
ven_mask <- terra::mask(ven_crop, ven_v)
# plot the masked raster layer
plot(ven_mask)
```


# Prepare data frame

The next step would be to prepare the data frame. First, we would load the raster values from masked raster layer to the data frame named `df.ven`. Then, replace the column name containing raster values to `value` with the use of new data frame called `df.new`.

```{r dfPrep1, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

# raster values as dataframe
df.ven <- as.data.frame(ven_mask)
# new dataframe with value column
df.new <- data.frame(value=NA)
# rename column to match with new df
colnames(df.ven) <- colnames(df.new)
# check the columns with values of the prepared dataframe
head(df.ven)
```

Similarly, we will prepare new data frame with only WDPAID to receive the final results.

```{r dfPrep2, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

# empty data frame to receive results
df.final <- data.frame(WDPAID=555705224)
```

# Compute area of land cover classes

To carry out the final and main step of this analysis i.e. to compute the area of land cover classes, `area` function from the package `terra` would be used. We first compute the area of the masked raster layer `ven_mask` in square kilometer (sqkm). Then, we calculate the area in sqkm for single row of the data frame `df.ven`.

```{r areaComp, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

# area of masked raster
area_sqm <- terra::area(ven_mask)
# in sqkm
area_sqkm <- area_sqm/1000000
# area per row of dataframe
area_sqkm_per_cell <- area_sqkm/nrow(df.ven)
```

Finally, we call the function `lc_clases` from the sourced script `copernicus-land-cover.R` which takes the data frame `df.ven` as argument and returns another data frame `data.final` in long table format with the area of individual land cover classes.

```{r lcComp, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

# call the function lc_classes and receive the result
df.final_long <- lc_classes(df.ven)
# view the resulting data
df.final_long
```

So, for a single polygon for the year 2015, we computed the area of each land cover classes present in the polygon. We can see that among 23 discrete classes, the polygon we used consists of eight different classes with open forest comprising the largest area of the polygon.


In order to carry out land cover change analysis, we can load raster layer for another year of which we want to see the changes in the area of land cover classes and then finally subtract the area from the respective years.


In the end we are going to have a look how long the rendering of this file took so that people get an idea about the processing speed of this routine.

```{r time, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

stoptime<-Sys.time()
print(starttime-stoptime)
```
