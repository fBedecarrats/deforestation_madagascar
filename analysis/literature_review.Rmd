## Effectiveness of PES

[Effects of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) on Deforestation and Poverty in Low and Middle Income Countries: A Systematic Review](https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/media/k2/attachments/0176_IDCG_Samii_Environmental_payment_PLS_EN.pdf)

- 11 studies in four countries (Costa Rica, China, Mexico, and Mozambique) up to November 2013
- None use random assignment

- Effect of PES on deforestation may be overestimated
    - PES programmes may be applied to areas of land that landowners do not intend to deforest
    - Landowners may "compensate" by cutting down trees on lands that are not included in PES programmes
    - PES programmes only have a modest effect on deforestation
    - On average the rate of deforestation is reduced by 0.21 per cent per year
    - Land for which PES payments were made would have remained forested even in the absence of payments
    - PES may be slightly more effective in iincreasing forest cover than it is at preventing deforestation
- PES improved participating householdsâ€™ incomes by 4 per cent in Mozambique, and by 14 per cent in China. 
    - More likely to benefit wealthier landowners
    - Less effective in poor areas
    - Participation by the poor is constrained by 
        - documentary requirements
        - high transaction costs
        - lack of understanding of programmes

- Efforts to apply counterfactual analysis to assess the effects of environmental programs have been rather limited to date, but studies using quasi-experimental approaches do exist
- Studies that include matching
    1. Arriagada et al. (2012)
        - matched and difference-in-difference adjusted eligible farms in Sarapiqui with out PSA
        - 202 farms
    2. Arriagada et al. (2011)
        - nearest-neighbor matched census tracts without PSA (best covariate balance estimate) with multiple regression adjustment
        - 8,073 census tracts
    3. Robalino and Pfaff (2013)
        - bias-adjusted matched forest pixels without PSA
        - 50,000 1kmX1km locations randomly sampled from across Costa Rica
    4. Robalino et al. (2008)
        - bias-adjusted matched forest pixels without PSA
        - 50,000 1kmX1km locations randomly sampled from across Costa Rica
    5. Alix-Garcia et al. (2012)
        - bias-adjusted matched properties rejected in 2004 or online for PSAH for 2006
        - 633 parcels of which 371 were PSAH recipients and the rest were either rejected in 2004 or online for 2006
        - only study made use of a source of a plausibly exogenous variation
        - sampled "matched control" parcels from properties that were idiosyncratically excluded from the first PSAH cohort but admitted to a subsequent cohort, thereby reducing concerns about self-selection bias
        - "others ought to emulate" this study model
    6. Honey-Roses et al. (2011)
        - spatial matched properties without MBCF
        - 9,441 GIS polygons in Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve
    7. Hegde and Bull (2011)
        - nearest neighbor matched local non-participant households
        - 290 households (including 96 participating households)
- Confounder control
    - Many studies failed to include the full combination of 
        - forest land quality
        - socio-economic conditions
        - conditions determining accessibility to markets that are often associated with both PES take-up and PES impact
    - The importance of all three factors for both take-up and forest cover trends were demonstrated across the studies themselves
    - It is reasonable to assume that PES programs tend to be applied systematically to parcels that landowners have no intention to deforest
- Leakage (aka leakage, slippage)
    - majority of studies failed to give explicit attention to the issue of spill-over
    - upward bias
- Ingredients needed for study
    - exogenous assignment
    - control confounding bias
    - Measurment strategy avoids motivation bias
    - accounts for spillovers
- poor state of the evidence base for conservation programming
