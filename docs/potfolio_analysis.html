Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/openkfw/mapme.protectedareas/tree/b967ed6bc6fb1246939d3333c204922f4efb661f" target="_blank">b967ed6</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    contributing.html
    Ignored:    mapme.protectedareas.Rproj

Unstaged changes:

    Modified:   analysis/potfolio_analysis.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Conservation finance is an important field in the KfW development bank. The evaluation department, together with operational departments tries to learn more about our conservation projects by using internal data as well as open geodata to assess the relevance and effectiveness of our projects in Latin-america. The main impact goals of our conservation financing efforts can be summarized under three broad topics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Conservation of biological diversity</li>
<li>Mitigation of global climate change e.g by reducing deforestation</li>
<li>Improvement of livelihoods of the local population that uses the natural ressources</li>
</ol>
<p>Conservation finance has increased in importance for German development cooperation and considerably more financial resources had been spent in Latin-america since 2004.</p>

We machted our Latinamerica portfolio with the <em>World Database on Protected Areas - WDPA</em> (IUCN) and used data from the <em>Digital Observatory for Protected Areas Explorer DOPA</em> (EU/JRC) to make a first assessment of our portfolio. Our database currently comprises 433 PAs in latinamerica (only) which are situated in 16 different countries. Those areas can be broadly categorized into 360 terrestrial, 19 marine, and 43 partial marine/terrestrial protected areass. They cover a total surface of 1.106 Mio. km<sup>2</sup> which is about 3.1 times the size of Germany.</p>

of the main policy goals of our financial support. In total KfW’s financial support contributed to the protection of a forest area which extents over 0.896 Mio km<sup>2</sup> or 2.5 times the size of Germany. Most of the supported forests are situated in the Amazon basin where we cooperate with the governments of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>Geodata can also tell us a bit about the relevance of conserving forests to mitigate global climate change. The following chart shows us, for example, how much carbon is stored in the vegetation and soils for supported protected areas. Conservation finance can help to keep this carbon in place that might be otherwise released to the atmosphere due to deforestation and forest degradation.</p>

<p>As we can see the protected areas network in Latin America stores 20.69 Gigatons of carbon that, if released completely to the atmosphere, would generate emissions which correspond to 103 times the annual GHG emissions of Germany. Most of this carbon is stored in Brazil which is by far the largest country on the continent with the biggest network of protected areass. With the creation of this database and the use of open geodata we hope to be able to learn more about the effectiveness of our projects to reduce deforestation, the loss of biological diversity and to improve the livelihoods of people worldwide living in and around protected areas.</p>
